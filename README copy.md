React Final:


Using an online API of your choice, or multiple APIs (or if no API can be found, using an array for in-memory storage is okay as well), create a React project of your choice. You will be working on this for the next three weeks.

- use React Router and have at least 3 pages 

- Use React Bootstrap or an alternative styling library 

- Contain at least 10 components
